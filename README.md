# Flights
The project is to load data through a CSV file and write C program that will conduct a variety of queries on that data.
The dataset (attached) is a modified CSV file on all International flight departing from US Airports between January and June 2020 reported by the US Department of Transportation (https://data.transportation.gov/Aviation/International_Report_Passengers/xgub-n9bw). Each record holds a route (origin to destination) operated by an airline.
You May Search by Route, Origin Airport, Destination Airport, Or Airline


All data is loaded into an array of RouteRecordâ€™s which will they be queried in main()
